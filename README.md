# Weather Report Website

This project is a **Weather Report Website** built using **Python**, **Django**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The website allows users to get current weather information for any city they input, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

## Features
- **Search for weather by city**: Users can search for weather information by entering a city name.
- **Current weather data**: The website displays current weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather conditions.
- **Responsive design**: The site adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Beautiful user interface**: The website features a clean and user-friendly interface built with **HTML** and **CSS**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The backend is built using Python.
- **Django**: The web framework used to handle HTTP requests, manage templates, and render data dynamically.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Used for structuring and styling the frontend, making the website visually appealing and responsive.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: The weather data is fetched from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/), which provides real-time weather updates.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-report-website.git
cd weather-report-website
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

**For Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**For macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Add OpenWeatherMap API Key
In order to fetch weather data, you'll need an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). Once you have the key, you can add it to your environment variables or directly in your `settings.py`.

Example in `settings.py`:
```python
WEATHER_API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here'
```

### 6. Migrate the database
Django requires database migrations before running the app:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Run the development server
Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 8. Visit the website
Once the server is running, open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the weather report website.
